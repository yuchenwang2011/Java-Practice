Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number 
of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 
00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int ones = 0;
        while(n != 0) {
            if( (n & 1) != 0) ones++;
            n = n >>> 1;
        }
        return ones;
