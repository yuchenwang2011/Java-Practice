Total Accepted: 9266 Total Submissions: 24962 Difficulty: Medium
The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. 
There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." 
Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. 
After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". 
It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
Example 2:
     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

Answer:
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int rob(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return 0;
        int[] result = helper(root);
        return Math.max(result[0], result[1]);
    }
    
    public int[] helper(TreeNode root){
        if(root == null) return new int[2];
        int[] left = helper(root.left);
        int[] right = helper(root.right);
        int[] result = new int[2];
        result[0] = Math.max(left[0], left[1]) + Math.max(right[0], right[1]);
        result[1] = root.val + left[0] + right[0];
        return result;
    }
}
