272. Closest Binary Search Tree Value II
Hard

Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

Note:

Given target value is a floating point.
You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

Example:
Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286, and k = 2

    4
   / \
  2   5
 / \
1   3

Output: [4,3]

Follow up:
Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?

Hint:
1. Consider implement these two helper functions:
getPredecessor(N), which returns the next smaller node to N.
getSuccessor(N), which returns the next larger node to N.
2. Try to assume that each node has a parent pointer, it makes the problem much easier.
3. Without parent pointer we just need to keep track of the path from the root to the current node using a stack.
4. You would need two stacks to track the path in finding predecessor and successor node separately.
