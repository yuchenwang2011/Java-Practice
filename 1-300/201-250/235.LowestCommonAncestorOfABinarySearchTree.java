Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: 
“The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v 
and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants 
(where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. 
Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, 
since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Answer:
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root.val > p.val && root.val > q.val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        else if (root.val < p.val && root.val < q.val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        return root;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root == null || root.val == p.val || root.val == q.val) return root;
        while(root != null){
            if(root.val < q.val && root.val < p.val) root = root.right; 
            else if (root.val > p.val && root.val > q.val) root = root.left;
            else return root;
        }
        return root;
    }
}
